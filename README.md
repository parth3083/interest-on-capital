<br>
This C++ software is a strong financial tool for calculating and recording capital investment interest. Users provide pertinent information such as the investment duration, interest rate, and principle amount. The interest accumulated over time is then calculated by the programme. This project is unique in that it can create an Excel spreadsheet automatically, storing and presenting the results in a logical and approachable manner.

The Excel sheet that is created offers an extensive documentation of the investment, enabling customers to monitor and assess their financial progress over a period of time. This project is a useful tool for people and companies looking to manage and maximise their capital assets since it makes financial planning and record-keeping simpler.
